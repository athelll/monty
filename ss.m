The sun is shining.
I like chocolate.
He runs fast.
She sings beautifully.
The cat meowed.
We played games.
They laughed together.
John reads books.
The flower smells sweet.
It rained yesterday.
Lisa dances gracefully.
The bird flew high.
She painted a picture.
The car stopped suddenly.
They ate lunch.
The dog barked loudly.
We went to the park.
